This project was created as part of an object-oriented programming (OOP) challenge to practice class design in Python. The goal was to build a Pet class with attributes like hunger, energy, and happiness, along with methods to interact with the pet.

To make it more engaging, a Bull Terrier (dog/canine) version of the pet was introduced, allowing for play, training, and even learning tricks! The project emphasizes key OOP concepts such as encapsulation, state management, and method interactions, making it a great hands-on learning experience.
## Pet Class â€“ Bull Terrier Edition

This project is designed to implement a **Pet class** in Python. The goal is to simulate a petâ€™s behaviors, including eating, playing, sleeping, and training, while maintaining attributes like hunger, energy, and happiness.

### ðŸ”¹ Features:
- **Realistic Pet Behavior** â€“ The pet loses energy when playing, gains hunger when training, and rests to recover.
- **Learning Tricks** â€“ The pet can train to learn new tricks, with a chance of failure based on energy and hunger levels.
- **Status Updates** â€“ Displays the petâ€™s current state at any time.
- **Breed Customization** â€“ Focused on a playful **Bull Terrier**, known for its high energy and intelligence.

###  How It Works:
1. The pet starts with default attributes.
2. Actions like eating, playing, and sleeping modify these attributes.
3. Training allows the pet to learn tricks dynamically.
4. The `get_status()` method displays the petâ€™s condition.
5. The `show_tricks()` method lists learned tricks.
